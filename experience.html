						<h4>Associate Product Manager</h4>
						<p>
						I currently am the product manager for the APT Index product. Some of my product contributions include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Worked in a team to create and release an independent Index product </li>
							<li>Creation of case studies and custom reports resulting in several clients licensing the Index product</li>
							<li>Investigated using the Index in test vs. control scenarios giving the ability to measure impact of chain-wide business initiatives. The feature is now released into the core Test and Learn product.</li>
							<li>Leading the Index media efforts to comment on the state of the US economy regularly in publications like Bloomberg, WSJ etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						Other product related work :</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Currently working on coming up with a solution and a process for the internationalization of our products</li>
							<li>Requirements generation for the first few milestones for the targeting and modeling workflow in the core Test and Learn product</li>
						</ul>	
						<p>
						I conduct company-wide product 'voteables' sessions across all products regularly to gather enhancement ideas and feedback from APT users. Across different teams, I have used usage tracking data to make product decisions including feature release, deprecation and creating requirements for enhancements.
						</p>
						<p>
						I am also the school manager for MIT and lead the recruiting efforts for all roles and positions at MIT.

						<h4>Graduate Research Assistant</h4>
						<p>
						I built heuristic models to solve the scheduling optimization problem and enabled real time decision making in the LCD TV manufacturing line at Samsung. The models could conceptualize inventory transfer strategies across different manufacturing lines while accommodating a wide mix of products. I also built inventory control models to reduce inventory levels and flow times within the line.

						<h4>Summer Analyst Intern</h4>
						<p>
						The Sales and Trading internship was a rotational program across three trading desks. In the first rotation, I worked on Direct Execution Services (algorithmic equity trading) and identified trends in liquidity patterns around key dates and created pairs trading strategies. On my second rotation in structured fixed income, I built a tool to accurately rate fixed income products based on the standards set by rating agencies. In my final rotation through the Electronic Volatility Trading desk, I used historical data and a statistical learning model to devise a trading strategy for volatility swaps.

						<h4>Summer Intern</h4>

						During this internship, I explored a new class of techniques used for wave scattering based imaging. In particular, I investigated a class of methods that could be used to attain super-resolution (resolution beyond Rayleigh limit) by modeling higher order scattering effects. We showed that point scatterers placed closer than the Rayleigh limit can be resolved through this method and that super-resolution could be used to improve resolution of larger objects in elastic media.

						<p>
						As a part of this internship, I designed a rear view system for automobiles that increased viewing area directly behind the automobile and eliminated blind spots. Using software based proof of concept for the design enabled us to save time in making preliminary prototypes. In addition, I also worked on characterizing prediction accuracies in the plastic injection molding process using six sigma methodology.

						I worked on designing a human powered multi-purpose cargo carrying vehicle for usage in rural India. Originally meant to be just a means to carry water from sources of water for rural women, we worked on a modular design that allowed the product to meet a few additional use cases.
